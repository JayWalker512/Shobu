# Shobu AI Starter Kit

The AI Starter Kit provides a basic framework for writing an AI that interacts with the main Shobu AI Playground game engine.

This kit is utilizes many of the classes and methods from the base game framework to simplify and reduce the amount of code that
needed to be written. If you wish to write a Shobu AI in a different programming language, you can use this code as a template 
from which to port the relevant classes and methods necessary to implement the basic AI capabilities.
